# The-road-to-Kali-Nethunter
Porting Kali Nethunter (Memo)
---
I describe the steps for building and installing a Kali NetHunter for two devices: Samsung J7 2016 and LG X210DS.

You should know that most likely you will lose all data from the device. If this is undesirable, please backup your data.

For LG, NetHunter is a beautiful decoration. You can use Metasploit, MIDI attacks, and something else on the little things. Wireless or HID attacks are not available. But for flashing practice, it is not bad. And someone might need it.

If I missed something, you have questions or you need help, feel free to write in Issues. To the best of my abilities and knowledge, I will help, or we will study together.
